How to Build a Password Validator with JavaScript
Enforcing secure passwords is an essential part on any login system. The first step in this process is ensuring that users select a password which matches a set of criteria. Here is a fairly common set of requirements when setting a password:

    Minimum length of 8 characters
    Contains a lowercase letter
    Contains an uppercase letter
    Contains a number or special character

Unfortunately, all these restrictions can put a bit of a damper on the user experience. This is especially true if the user is not warned about the requirements before submitting a form. One solution Iâ€™ve seen to this problem is checking the password validity inline as the user types. This makes it easy for the user to quickly see if their password fits the requirements before submitting the form.

In this tutorial, we will be building a password validator using JavaScript. The validator will check the password as the user types and compare it to the list of requirements. It will also provide a visual representation of which requirements have already been met.
